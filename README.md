### SCRUM

SCRUM Master Certifications:

For Developers, I recommend continuing your CSM certification by persuing the CSD, Certified SCRUM Developer, certification.  This will teach skills to allow one to be highly proficient in working on a SCRUM developer team.  Topics covered are TDD, Mob programming, CI/CD, and XP!

I recommend courses taught by Chet Hendrickson https://www.hendricksonxp.com/about.html.  Chet was [one of the first signators of the agile manefesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/display/000000001.html).
